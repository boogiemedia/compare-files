# Image Comparison Script

This Python script compares images in two directories and prints the names of images that are not similar.



## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- numpy
- pathlib

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pathlib
```



## Usage

1. __Run the Script:__ Run the script in your Python environment. The script will automatically read the files from the imported and exported directories.

2. __Check the Output:__ The script will print the names of the files in the imported directory.

3__file size:__The script will check the sizes of the compressed files in both directories. If thereâ€™s a size difference, it will print an error message with the file name and the size difference in bytes.

4.__Image Comparison:__ The script will compare the images in both directories. If the total difference between two images exceeds a certain threshold, it will print a message indicating that the images are not similar.


## Technology

 __open CV__ (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an excellent choice for this script due to several reasons:

1. __Image Processing Capabilities:__ OpenCV is a powerful library specifically designed for computer vision and image processing. It provides a wide range of functions that can handle tasks from basic image manipulation to complex object detection.

2. __Performance:__ OpenCV is written in C/C++, which means itâ€™s incredibly fast. Itâ€™s designed to be efficient with memory and processing power, which is crucial when dealing with large images or real-time applications.

3. __Cross-Platform and Language Support:__ OpenCV can be used with many programming languages including Python, and itâ€™s cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems like Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

4. __Community and Documentation:__ OpenCV has a large and active community. This means that if you encounter issues or need to learn how to do something, thereâ€™s a good chance that someone else has already solved that problem. The documentation is also comprehensive and well-maintained.

5. __Functionality:__ In this script, OpenCV is used to read images, check their dimensions, and compute the absolute difference between them. These are all tasks that OpenCV excels at.

In summary, OpenCVâ€™s robust functionality, efficiency, and strong community support make it an ideal choice for this image and file comparison script. ðŸ˜Š
